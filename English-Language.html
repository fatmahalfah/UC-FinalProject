        <h1>Benefits of majoring in English after graduation</h1>
        <P>Graduates of the English language specialization are distinguished from others by: More job opportunities: It provides job opportunities for a person who masters the English language, as most companies and jobs have become dependent on the English language, even job interviews are conducted only in English, and the language has become a prerequisite for work. Promote scientific research: English is the official language on the Internet and the language used by most major websites. That is why research on these sites and the ability to understand, translate and transmit content is important. Admission to universities: Some universities and colleges require students to be proficient in the English language. If students want to complete their higher studies, they must master it. Ability to write: Being able to write does not mean only writing coherent and grammatically correct sentences, paragraphs and ideas! Rather, the ability to be creative in writing, such as the ability to write and invent new texts that do not exist, such as poetry</P>
