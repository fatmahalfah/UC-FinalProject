     <div id="defind-text-NU">
<h1>Nuclear Engineering definition</h1> 
<P>The “Nuclear Engineering” specialization seeks to explore, explore, and research new sources of energy. It also pays attention to focusing on practical applications in the field of nuclear energy, nuclear plants, and nuclear reactor design. Nuclear engineering is one of the newest engineering disciplines Relatively speaking, in addition to being a dangerous specialty on the other hand. Therefore, those who want to go to this specialty should think carefully before registering .</P>
<h1>Number of years studying Nuclear Engineering</h1>
<p>The requirements for obtaining a bachelor’s degree in all humanitarian, scientific, administrative and social disciplines take four academic years, and the period can be reduced to three or three and a half years depending on the number of hours and semesters registered by students, unlike engineering majors; It takes five academic years .. </p>
<h1>Advantages of majoring in nuclear engineering</h1>
<P>1. The increase in energy alternatives, and this is considered one of the most important advantages because the rise of energy alternatives leads in turn to an increase in productivity, and the increase in productivity leads to an increase in national income. 2. Specialization aims to reduce the amount of waste. 3. The existence of a syndicate of engineers. 4. Giving the opportunity for graduates of civil engineering to work in Various other engineering fields. 5. Get high salaries</P>
<h1>Disadvantages of studying nuclear engineering</h1>
<P>1. a bit difficult to specialize. 2. The limited number of institutions specialized in this field locally. 3. The exposure of engineers to radiation, and it can lead to It leads to disease. 4. The impact of nuclear energy on the environment, it can cause climate change, and global warming. 5. causing environmental pollution</P>
