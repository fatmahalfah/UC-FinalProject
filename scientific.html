            <p>First: Make room for creativity and invention….Second: Modernity and development with the development of science and technology. Thus, keep pace with these developments in order to make a difference in the world and make Life is better.</p>
            <p>Third: Acquisition of high skills such as: innovatio,Decision making,solving problems,communication skills, Project management and organization …</p> <p> Fourth: high wages , Fifth: Every subject and course of engineering contains an applied and practical aspect. This gives students the opportunity to apply everything they study so that they are ready to engage in the labor market And that's right after they graduate ...</p>

           <h3 class="AC"> the future of Engineering </h3>
           <div class="topic1">
           <p></p> The demand for all branches of engineering is generally great in various parts of the world as it contributes to inventing many things in order to solve the problems facing man.</p> <p>Although it is a globally sought-after discipline, it may be classified as saturated, or stagnant in some countries. Satisfaction is defined as the arrival of specialization to the point of sufficiency in the labor market in a country. Thus, it is difficult for its graduates to find a job.</p> <p> Engineering in all its branches ranges from saturated to stagnant in Jordan, according to the Civil Service Commission. However, the demand for engineering specializations is increasing in the Gulf countries in general, as is the case in the State of Egypt, but the demand for the engineering specialization in architecture is high, and engineering specializations are required in European countries, especially civil engineering, and electrical engineering .</p>

           <h3 class="AD">The ease and difficulty of engineering majors</h3>
           <div class="topic2">
        <p>We cannot say whether engineering majors are easy or difficult. It can be easy for some people, and difficult for others. This point depends on the students' prior scientific knowledge.</p> <p> Perhaps its ease and flexibility cover the expansion of horizons of thinking and creativity. While its difficulty lies in the need for prior scientific knowledge and an attachment to scientific subjects such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and the biology</p>
           </div>
        <h3 class="AE">Number of years studying engineering</h3>
        <div class="topic3">
<p>Unlike other majors, all engineering majors take 5 to 6 years instead of 4 years. There is a course in the graduation semester It's called "field training"</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(113, 96, 169)";>" the Field Training"</h3>
<p>All engineering majors are distinguished by the field training course that links students' theoretical knowledge with their applied knowledge, and students gain knowledge and prior experience of working life after graduation</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(59, 61, 162);">CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>In the end, the engineering major requires a lot of skills, and previous scientific knowledge, so that students can engage in it. It is worth noting that the many engineering disciplines give way to greater jobs and employment opportunities in the labor market. Engineering also has many advantages. But one of its challenges is that it needs a lot of time, and effort</p>
<p>It is a good idea for anyone who wants to study engineering to read about all the disciplines that branch off from engineering, so that they can identify their tendencies. Thus, determine the specialization you desire study it</p>
<p>We hope that this article has satisfied your knowledge, and answered what is going on Questions in your mind ..</p>
