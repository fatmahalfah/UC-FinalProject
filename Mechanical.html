        <h1>Mechanical Engineering definition</h1>
        <br>
<p>Mechanical engineering is a branch of mechanical engineering, which is concerned with the study, design, manufacture and installation, in addition to another methods
engineering is also concerned with all forms and types of energy, because it fundamentally focuses on forces, energy, and motion. Mechanical engineering .</p>
<p>began to appear when Newton set the most important basic laws of physics that resulted in the emergence of mechanics, and the development of Mechanics very much coincided
with global development and the industrial revolution ... </p>
    <h1>Number of years studying Mechanical engineering</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Most of the engineering majors take a period of no less than five years, where the hours of specialization are 160 academic hours Accredited .</p>
    <h1>Advantages of studying mechanical engineering</h1>
    <br>
    <p>1. Acquisition of problem-solving skill. 2. The existence of a syndicate of engineers. 3. Specialization is required in the labor market. 4. Have a good income. </p>
    <P> 5. Mechanical engineers can benefit from their academic experience in their working life. For example, they can repair machines and electrical equipment at home based on theoretical and scientific knowledge .</P>
    <h1>Disadvantages of studying mechanical engineering</h1>
    <P>1. A person's health may be affected and suffer from neck and back pain after a period of time. 2. The intensity of competition that requires the engineer to work hard He is constantly improving himself.</P>
    <P>3. The urgent need to follow the rules of security and safety and be careful Caution and caution in order to avoid the occurrence of danger.4. Additional efforts fall on the shoulders of engineers, which include reporting, supervision and evaluation processes, and attendance meetings, and more</P>
    <P>5.Work assignments can range from short to long term depending on the nature of the job, and this can be a positive point for a dynamic person who does not like routine ..</P>
