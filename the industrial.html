        <h1>the industrial engineering definition</h1>  
    <p>Industrial Engineering is an engineering profession that is concerned with the optimization of complex processes, systems, or organizations by developing, improving and implementing integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information and equipment. Industrial engineering is central to manufacturing operations.</p>
<h1>Number of Years of Studying Industrial</h1>
<p>Engineering Most engineering majors take four years to graduate with the exception of engineering and medical majors, because study hours for other majors range from 132 to 135 credit hours. While the academic hours for engineering majors vary between 160 and 165 academic hours. Therefore, the duration of study for an industrial engineering major is five years</p>
<h1>Pros and cons of industrial engineering major</h1>
<h3>Positives:</h3>
<p>1. The industrial sector is a broad and large-growth field. 2. The possibility of industrial engineers joining the Engineers Syndicate. 3. The increasing need for graduate generations of engineering majors Industrial in light of the complexity of industrial organizations and services modern. 4. Industry plays a big role in ensuring the quality of services products, in addition to increasing efficiency and productivity</p>
<h3>negatives:</h3>
<p>1.The labor market suffers from saturation. 2. Some believe that it is a male specialty. 3. It is difficult to achieve success in specialization without possessing qualities Leading personality. 4. The urgent need to follow the rules of security and safety and be careful Take care to avoid injuries</p>
